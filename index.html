      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <h3>Handball Teams</h3>
      <p>When I was in 9th grade in 2021, I joined the handball team at my school. Ever since joining the handball team, my life has not been dull anymore. Instead, I've been living a very fulfilling life, which has given me a passion for life. Moreover, I've made a lot of new friends, which has made me feel very happy.</p >

    <p>In 2023, I represented the Macau Handball Association to participate in the IHF Handball Competition held in Hong Kong. The opponents in this competition were from different countries. Through this competition, it has improved my effective communication skills with my teammates, and I have also learned to accept failure.</p>

      <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
      <h3>Macao Public Security Police</h3>
      <p>I joined the Macao Public Security Police in 2021 . These are very valuable groups that provide many opportunities for young people to learn different skills and values. Through participation in these activities, I have learned how to cooperate with others, build self-confidence, and develop leadership abilities. Additionally, I have met many friends who share common interests, and have expanded my social circle. These friends can become my mentors and confidants in the future, as we grow together and support each other in life.</p >

In 2021, I participated in a police cadet experience camp, which was a four-day and three-night program. During the camp, I experienced the hardships of being a police cadet. Only the members who performed excellently were able to officially become part of the Junior Police Force. In 2021, I officially became a member of the Junior Police Force.</p>

   <p> During the period of 2021 and 2022, I represented the Junior Police Force to provide community service. For example, I participated in crime prevention campaigns, school visits, and performance at the Police-Community Fun Day. I also had the opportunity to visit various government departments in Macau, which allowed me to better understand the government structure of Macau. Through these experiences, I have become an energetic and outgoing youth.</p>
